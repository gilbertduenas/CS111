Labs for CS111
========================
This contains examples of code that I have written. I have published my code as it was submitted to the university with minor formatting corrections.

Lab 15 uses a two-dimensional array to calculate test scores entered by the user.

Lab 17 demonstrates the separation of code into header and cpp files, as well as calling functions from classes. 

Lab 18 is a simple counting exercise that displays stars in descending order.
